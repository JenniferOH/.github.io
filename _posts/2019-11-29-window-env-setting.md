Installing Python on Windows
====================================

1. Choose python version you want to install from this link: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install Python install file according to your Windows environment, for example:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-374/
(I downloaded Windows x86-64 executable installer and you will get a file named 'python-3.7.4-amd64')

3. Run the installer with the 'Set Python Path' box checked

4. Check if the python is installed on your cmd (you must open a new one)
If the python version is not printed, something must have gone wrong.



Installing Anaconda on Windows
====================================
